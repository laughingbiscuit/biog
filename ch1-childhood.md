% Childhood

On the July 10th 1992, a little baby boy was born to Helen and Martin Davis. 
They named him Sean. His father bought him a toy, a blue dog, that still lives
with Sean today. His name is 'Bluedog'. His family said 'he was the ugliest baby
ever seen', as he had a giant head!

For three years, he lived in a town called Kingsbury and after 16 months he gained
a new sister called 'Lydia'. Sean was a very sensitive boy and spent his time
helping his sister as she had a lot of trouble walking and talking.

As a child, Sean was very anxious but enjoyed spending his time in the garage
with his father working on cars and motorbikes. He got his first scooter at the age
of 8.

At a young age, Sean learned the guitar, drums and also spent a lot of time in 
drama clubs. He was in a short film and many plays. He went to the same drama 
school as Sansa Stark from Games of Thrones!

Sean loved his family, with over 20 cousins. He especially loved his grandma! When 
some of his family members died, Sean learned about loss and became a very anxious
child. Despite his anxiety, Sean would make lots of friends and especially friends
from different countries and backgrounds. This would encourage him to travel in future!

Sean's family had many pets, including:

- Mac the dog
- Billy the dog
- Tizzie the dog
- Minnie the mouse
- Maisy the mouse
- Bobby the rabbit
- Honey the rabbit
- Diamond the rabbit
- Ebony the rabbit
- Bubble the guinea pig
- Squeak the guinea pig
- Saffy the horse

and lots of hamsters that he can't remember.
